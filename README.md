# demo
demo code
this little repo contains some demo code.  it doesn't really do much.  it is just to show that I know how to code and perhaps how to spel

# metar.R
- this script processes some metar data.  Unfortunately, the source file is too big for a repo.  But the script is included anyway, even though it can't be run.
- the script contains a config list, which specifies the number of rows to read in.  Turn this down during development, to make the code run very fast.  Turn it up later, to process the entire source file.
- the output is redirected to a log file.
